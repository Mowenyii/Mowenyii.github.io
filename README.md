## Quick Start

1. Fork this REPO and rename to `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` is your github USERNAME.
1. Configure the google scholar citation crawler:
    1. Find your google scholar ID in the url of your google scholar page (e.g., https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID), where `SCHOLAR_ID` is your google scholar ID.
    1. Set GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID variable to your google scholar ID in `Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret` of the REPO website with `name=GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID` and `value=SCHOLAR_ID`.
    1. Click the `Action` of the REPO website and enable the workflows by clicking *"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"*. This github action will generate google scholar citation stats data `gs_data.json` in `google-scholar-stats` branch of your REPO. When you update your main branch, this action will be triggered. This action will also be trigger 08:00 UTC everyday.
1. Generate favicon using [favicon-generator](https://redketchup.io/favicon-generator) and download all generated files to `REPO/images`.
1. Modify the configuration of your homepage `_config.yml`:
    1. `title`: the title of your homepage
    1. `description`: the description of your homepage
    1. `repository`: USER_NAME/REPO_NAME  
    1. `google_analytics_id` (optional): google analytics ID
    1. SEO Related keys (optional): get these keys from search engine consoles (e.g. Google, Bing and Baidu) and paste here.
    1. `author`: the author information of this homepage, including some other websites, emails, city and univeristy.
    1. More configuration details are described in the comments.
1. Add your homepage content in `_pages/about.md`.
    1. You can use html+markdown syntax just same as jekyll.
    1. You can use a `<span>` tag with class `show_paper_citations` and attribute `data` to display the citations of your paper. Set the data to the google scholar paper ID. For
        ```html
        <span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span>
        ``` 
        > Q: How to get the google scholar paper ID?   
        > A: Enter your google scholar homepage and click the paper name. Then you can see the paper ID from `citation_for_view=XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the required paper ID.
1. Your page will be published at `https://USERNAME.github.io`.

## Debug Locally

1. Clone your REPO to local using `git clone`.
1. Install Jekyll building environment, including `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `GCC` and `Make` following [the installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).
1. Run `bash run_server.sh` (macOS / Linux) or `run_server.bat` (Windows) to start the Jekyll server with LiveReload.
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser.
1. If you change the source code of the website, the LiveReload server will refresh the page when possible.
1. When you finish the modification of your homepage, `commit` your changings and `push` to your remote REPO using `git` command.

### Bundler / `Could not find 'bundler'` / `PermissionError` (macOS)

If you see `Could not find 'bundler' (x.y.z) required by your Gemfile.lock`, macOS is often using the old system Ruby and `/usr/bin/bundle`, which does not see a user-installed Bundler.

`run_server.sh` does three things so local preview works **without sudo**:

1. Prepends `$(ruby -e 'puts File.join(Gem.user_dir, "bin")')` to `PATH` and installs the Bundler version listed under `BUNDLED WITH` in `Gemfile.lock` with `gem install bundler -v … --user-install` when missing.
2. Sets `GEM_HOME` and `GEM_PATH` to your user gem directory so RubyGems does **not** try to write caches under `/Library/Ruby/Gems/...` (that path triggers `Bundler::PermissionError` on Apple’s system Ruby).
3. Runs `bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle` so all gems install under `./vendor/bundle` (gitignored), not into the system tree.

You still need a working `gem` (Xcode Command Line Tools or a [Homebrew Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)). If `gem install` fails with SSL errors or your Ruby is too old, use Homebrew or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and run `bash run_server.sh` again.
